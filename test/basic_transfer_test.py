'''
This test examines the basic function of your RDT and congestion control.
There will be a packet loss around 21s after the program starts.
Your peer should retransmit and receive the entire data correctly and dump them to serialized dict.
To show your congestion control implementation, you need to plot your sending window size change in a plot similar to the one in
the document.
If you can pass RDT test, you will gain 10 points.
Congestion control will be inspected by humans on your presentation day. If you show the correct implementation of congestion control,
You will get 12 points. 22 in total.
However, note that this is just a sanity test. Passing this test does *NOT* guarantee your correctness in comprehensive tests.
